#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-tasks-axi.sh - run tasks-axi against THIS home's backlog from any working directory.
#
# Usage: fm-tasks-axi.sh [<tasks-axi command> [args...]]
#        fm-tasks-axi.sh --help
#
# Every routine firstmate backlog read or mutation goes through this command
# rather than a bare `tasks-axi`; `fm-tasks-axi.sh <command> --help` prints
# tasks-axi's own help. Arguments reach tasks-axi as given, apart from one
# rewrite that keeps file arguments meaning what the caller meant: a relative
# value of `--to` or any `--*-file` flag (`--body-file`, `--relation-file`, ...)
# is made absolute against the caller's working directory, because tasks-axi
# starts from the backlog root instead. `--report` stays as given: tasks-axi
# stores it verbatim as a link, which lifecycle transitions record relative to
# that same root.
#
# Safe note rewrite (wrapper-owned commands; they never reach tasks-axi as-is):
#   fm-tasks-axi.sh note-show <id>
#       Print the item's current note exactly, or exit non-zero with nothing on
#       stdout when the read fails. tasks-axi has no JSON reader - `--json` is a
#       mutation flag, and a bare `tasks-axi show <id> --full --json` prints a
#       TOON error on stdout and exits 2 - so this is the supported way to read
#       a note in a script.
#   fm-tasks-axi.sh note-rewrite <id> --body-file <new> --expect-body-file <seen>
#       Replace the note with <new>, archiving the previous one (tasks-axi
#       --archive-body). <seen> is the note the caller read with note-show and
#       composed <new> from; the rewrite refuses (exit 1, nothing written) when
#       the current note cannot be read or differs from <seen>, so a script that
#       ignored a failed read and composed on top of an empty note cannot erase
#       the real one. It also refuses an empty or whitespace-only <new>, an
#       unreadable file, and a tasks-axi without --archive-body (exit 2), and it
#       reads the note back after writing and fails if it does not match <new>.
#       Trailing newlines are ignored in both comparisons.
#   Typical use:
#       fm-tasks-axi.sh note-show "$id" > seen.md || exit 1
#       { cat seen.md; printf '\nNew line\n'; } > new.md
#       fm-tasks-axi.sh note-rewrite "$id" --body-file new.md --expect-body-file seen.md
# `show` (including `view`) and `list` decode stored captain-hold reasons
# through bin/fm-hold-reason-lib.sh, which owns the field-only decoding contract.
# Decoded reasons use quoted strings so embedded line breaks remain intact.
#
# Why it exists: a bare `tasks-axi` resolves the tracked `.tasks.toml` paths
# against its working directory, so from the code root it forks the queue
# whenever the home lives elsewhere; docs/configuration.md ("Backlog backend")
# owns that rationale.
#
# Addressing is bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh's fm_backlog_tasks_axi_addressing,
# the same resolution the lifecycle transitions use: tasks-axi runs from the
# configured data directory's parent, so that home's own `.tasks.toml` (or
# tasks-axi's built-in defaults, which keep the archive beside the backlog)
# supplies the adapter, done_keep, and the archive path; a markdown backlog is
# additionally pinned to `<data>/backlog.md` through TASKS_AXI_FILE. The
# environment carries the pin rather than a trailing --file so the no-command
# dashboard works too. A configured non-markdown adapter is addressed by that
# root alone, so an inherited TASKS_AXI_FILE is cleared for it.
#
# The data directory is FM_DATA_OVERRIDE, else $FM_HOME/data, else the code
# root's data/ (FM_HOME unset keeps the single-home layout unchanged).
#
# Refusals (exit 2, nothing run):
#   - tasks-axi missing from PATH;
#   - `show` (or its `view` alias) with --json, which tasks-axi rejects with a
#     TOON error a JSON parser then misreads as an empty note; use note-show;
#   - a caller-supplied --file, because this command owns the addressing and
#     tasks-axi would silently let the last --file win;
#   - `add` (or its `create` alias) with --start, so neither spelling places a
#     row In flight without the dispatch artifacts bin/fm-spawn.sh creates -
#     the task record, status file, and inbox that go with the row - which such
#     a row would lack, counting as live work nobody is doing that nothing
#     later would notice (`start <id>` stays a documented direct transition);
#   - a data directory that cannot be resolved, or whose backend configuration
#     cannot be read (bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh owns that diagnostic);
#   - a markdown `<data>/backlog.md` that is itself a symlink, because the
#     first write would replace the link with a private copy, exactly the fork
#     this command exists to prevent. Lifecycle transitions refuse the same file.
# Otherwise the exit status is tasks-axi's own, unless decoding a read fails;
# in that case the decoder's nonzero status is returned.
