# Behavior tests for the verified kiro-cli adapter across every kind.
#
# The facts pinned here are the ones a kiro-cli release could silently change and
# the ones a wrong guess would make dangerous:
#   1. kiro-cli publishes no harness-identity marker (the KIRO_* env family is
#      inheritable environment state, not identity), so detection is ancestry
#      alone on the anchored process names `kiro-cli` and the inner
#      `kiro-cli-chat`. The anchored match must never claim unrelated commands
#      (kiroshi, a bare bun), and a structural kiro-cli ancestor must outrank a
#      retained or inherited CLAUDECODE.
#   2. Control: interrupt is a single Escape (a single Ctrl+C does NOT quit the
#      new TUI), no clear key, no cancellation ack source, exit is /quit.
#  3. Kind coverage: kiro-cli runs ships, scouts, AND secondmates, because it
#      carries a verified primary supervision protocol
#      (docs/supervision-protocols/kiro-cli.md).
#   4. The launch is the INTERACTIVE steerable TUI carrying the brief via a
#      firstmate-encoded positional query with the trust flag (`-a` on V3,
#      `--trust-all-tools` on the explicit V2 fallback), --agent
#      firstmate-kiro, and per-task KIRO_HOME/KIRO_DATA_DIR/KIRO_CHAT_LOG_FILE,
#      with foreign markers cleared and the worktree isolated; it is NOT
#      --no-interactive and it does NOT type a pointer into the composer.
#      The agent file's tool list alone is not trust: a V3 agent declaring it
#      still stops on fs_write's Replace in File with a human approval prompt.
#   5. The turn-end signal is the TRACKED, firstmate-owned adapter
#      (bin/fm-kiro-turnend-hook.sh), never editing a captain-shared file.
#      Every Firstmate-owned hook command reaches it from any folder without
#      launcher environment, so a session resumed with plain kiro-cli keeps its
#      hooks. Its turn-ended touch fires only through a matching isolated-home
#      pointer plus registry token, a resumed worker writes busy state only
#      under its own recorded conversation, a resumed primary retakes only a
#      dead owner's lock, and its PRIMARY re-arm runs only in primary scope
#      without holding the turn end.
#   6. The launch gate refuses a rendered trust dialog (whose default is
#      "No, exit") without ever pressing Enter, and confirms a live TUI.
#   7. Busy state is the pinned rendered-tail fallback alone (nothing armed,
#      because no push writer could clear a seeded record), scoped to
#      harness=kiro-cli, busy on its anchors and unknown when they scroll out.
#   8. --model and --effort ride the launch (effort accepts the full
#      low|medium|high|xhigh|max vocabulary natively).
#   9. Teardown removes every kiro-cli artifact and the .fm-kiro-turnend pointer
#      is excluded from the unlanded-work dirty check.
